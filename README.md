> Front End Developer (Mobile App)

Currently living and working as a Front-End Developer with a strong focus on mobile application development. 

Iâ€™m currently part of the team at one of Indonesiaâ€™s leading digital banking platforms, where I help craft intuitive and high-performance mobile experiences. I'm also a lifelong learner, always exploring new tools, patterns, and best practices in frontend development.
