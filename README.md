> Front End Developer (Mobile App)

Currently living and working as a Front-End Developer with a strong focus on mobile application development. 

I’m currently part of the team at one of Indonesia’s leading digital banking platforms, where I help craft intuitive and high-performance mobile experiences. I'm also a lifelong learner, always exploring new tools, patterns, and best practices in frontend development.

In my daily work, I primarily use technologies like React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, and Jest to build and maintain scalable mobile applications. While my main focus is on cross-platform development, I'm also familiar with native mobile ecosystems on both Android and iOS, which helps me bridge gaps and collaborate effectively across platform.

- ⚒ &nbsp; I'm currently working with JS, React, React Native, Node, etc
- 🔎 &nbsp; I'm currently exploring Typescript, Bun, Hono JS, Remix, service deployment, etc
- 🔫 &nbsp; My daily tools include VS Code, Android Studio, Jenkins, MongoDB Compass, OpenShift, Git etc
- 👨‍💻 &nbsp; Occasionally take on part-time or freelance mobile app projects using React Native
- ⚽ &nbsp; I regularly go for a run and play football to stay active and refreshed
- 📬 &nbsp; Reach me at mdifasulthon@gmail.com

You can ask me or reach out about anything related to mobile app development, front-end engineering, user interface design, or working as a freelance developer.

Stay active, keep learning, and enjoy your day!
